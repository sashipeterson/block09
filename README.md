For this assignment I created a sample portfolio page with a home, about, and portfolio page. The home provides a brief description about my work, the about goes into deeper detail about the services I offer, and the portfolio is a page of hypothetical projects I would have worked on.

The website features best practices coding syntax, a clean layout with easily identifiable sections, and css stylings including color, layout, and spacing.

On the portfolio page, I also learned how to use javascript and css to create a button that scrolls you to the top of the page when you click on it, and shows your scrolling progress within the document.
